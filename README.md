# Space-Dodge-Shooter
A space-themed action game built with Scratch, where the player controls a bouncing yellow ball to dodge enemies and obstacles. The score increases over time as the player survives, while health and damage bars track performance. Colorful graphics and a city-in-space backdrop make the experience visually engaging.
